<p>Who is this boy who received such profuse praise from DVG? Of him, Prof. M. Hiriyanna once said, “When it comes to Alankara Shastra, this person can never err.” It is none other than K. Krishnamoorthy, the doyen of Indian aesthetics.</p>

<p>In the past two centuries, ill-willed westerners founded and gave currency to many misconceptions about India. Among them, the foremost is perhaps the following statement by Max Muller: “The idea of the Beautiful in Nature did not exist in the Hindu mind … The Beautiful as such did not exist for them.”  (Quoted by William Knight in The Philosophy of The Beautiful.)</p>

<p>Traditional Indian scholars such as Prof. M. Hiriyanna, Prof. Kuppuswami Shastri, P. V. Kane, S. K. De and V. Raghavan, among many others, worked hard to systematically debunk this. They were equally well-versed in English as they were in Sanskrit, and wrote to the foreigners in a language they understood well – English. K. Krishnamoorthy’s name is an integral part of this list. Taking the baton from his predecessors, he worked with a single-minded devotion for the cause of Alankara Shastra (Indian Aesthetics).</p>

<p>Scrupulousness was a feature that stood out in Krishnamoorthy’s personality, and an ever-alert inquisitiveness allowed him to develop remarkable insights in his field of interest. Today, his works have become touchstones to gauge scholarship. A person’s erudition in Alankara Shastra is tested in the light of his knowledge of K. Krishnamoorthy’s works. If he is familiar with them, he is a good scholar; otherwise he isn’t. The same idea was expressed many centuries ago by Bhattoji Diskshita, the famous grammarian, when he wrote of Appayya Dikshita – यत्कृतिबोधाबोधौ विद्वदविद्वद्विभाजकोपाधी ।</p>

<p>Krishnamoorthy was born in 1923 in Keralapura, a small village in Karnataka. Illness and poverty were his companions from birth; unencumbered by them, he set out on his quest after perfection. He had a brilliant academic career at the University of Mysore, and won prizes and gold medals for Sanskrit, English, and Kannada. The academic record set by him in BA (Hons.) examination was a stellar achievement – nobody had secured as much marks in the past twenty years, and it was not bettered in the next eighteen years. In the final examination of his post-graduation, three questions were asked, amounting to hundred marks. They were to be answered in three hours. Krishnamoorthy wrote an eighty-page answer to a single question and added a note at the end of it –“The answers to questions two and three can be found in this answer itself.” (This was recounted by Dr Mahesh Adakoli, a direct student of K. Krishnamoorthy)</p>
